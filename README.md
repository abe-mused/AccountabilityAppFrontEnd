# Linear - Accountability App (front-end)

This is the [backend repository](https://github.com/abe-mused/AccountabilityAppBackEnd) that's powering this web app. Ask ([@abe-mused](https://github.com/abe-mused)) for access.

Linear is a mobile application dedicated to keeping its users accountable for their long term achievements. Our focus is to develop a social media platform that helps the user gain a sense of responsibility and improve on his or her weak points, as a result, improving their accountability skills. We are aware that many individuals have multiple tasks to complete every day, and may struggle with completing those goals, which is where our accountability app will come into use. Our app will allow the end-user to put more emphasis on those specific goals, while also inspiring the people they meet through the app to achieve their goals too.

# Developer notes:

You need to have your Flutter environment setup. You can find the instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). You also need to have access to our AWS account which is where our backend is hosted. Ask ([@abe-mused](https://github.com/abe-mused)) if you don't have the credentials.

### General guidelines (you can change them as you see fit):

1. Always create a PR for any change you make (don't push anything directly to the `main` branch)
1. `git commit --amend` > `git commit`
1. Write unit tests for every change you make and include them in the same commit
